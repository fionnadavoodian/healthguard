    "description": "A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system developed in MATLAB to estimate the risk of gastric cancer. It incorporates 67 expert-defined rules and evaluates 13 clinically relevant risk factors including dietary habits, smoking, family history, and Helicobacter pylori infection. The system offers early detection insights by categorizing patients into Low, Moderate, or High risk groups.",
